# JSON-Schema-Generator-API
The JSON Schema Generator is a Python script that automates the process of generating JSON schemas based on predefined rules or templates. It can be used for request validation and documentation purposes in API development.
Features

    Generates JSON schemas based on predefined templates or rules.
    Supports various data types, including strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, dates, and date-time.
    Automatically determines the JSON type based on the provided values.
    Saves the generated schema to a file for future use.
    Provides an API endpoint for generating schemas and validating data.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-schema-generator.git
cd json-schema-generator

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Define a template in the script or provide your own JSON template.

    Start the server:

    bash

    python app.py

    Access the API endpoints:

        To generate a schema:
            Endpoint: POST /generate-schema
            Example: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @template.json http://localhost:5000/generate-schema

        To validate data against the schema:
            Endpoint: POST /validate-data
            Example: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @data.json http://localhost:5000/validate-data

        To access API documentation:
            Endpoint: GET /api-docs
            Example: curl http://localhost:5000/api-docs

    Customize the script to fit your specific requirements:
        Modify the template or provide your own JSON template.
        Implement input validation and sanitization functions to ensure data integrity and security.
        Enhance authentication and authorization logic to secure API endpoints.
        Implement additional features like response formatting, schema versioning, and integration with data persistence.
